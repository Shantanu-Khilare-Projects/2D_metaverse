1. Room Setup
Fixed Furniture:

Design a room layout with predefined furniture such as chairs, tables, and decorations.
Place chessboards at fixed locations in the room.
Player Spawn:

When players join, spawn them at random unoccupied locations in the room.
Ensure no two players are spawned on the same spot.
Player Movement:

Use a grid-based or freeform movement system for players to walk around using keyboard inputs (WASD or arrow keys).
Add collision detection to prevent walking through furniture or walls.
2. Core Features
2.1 Chess Interaction
Players can approach a chessboard and interact with it to start a game.
Once two players are at the same board, a prompt appears for them to play chess.
Lock the chessboard to others while a game is in progress.
2.2 Global Chat
A global chat feature allows all players in the room to communicate.
Display the chat in a sidebar or overlay on the screen.
Allow basic formatting like tagging players (@username).
2.3 Proximity-Based Messaging (Optional)
If implemented, when two players are close enough (within a certain radius), enable a private chat option between them.
Indicate proximity-based chat with a visual cue (e.g., a speech bubble or indicator).
3. User Flow
3.1 Joining the Room
Authenticate the player (optional, for saving stats later).
Spawn the player at a random location.
Render the room with fixed furniture and other active players.
3.2 Walking Around
Players use keyboard controls to navigate.
Update their position on the server in real time.
Broadcast position updates to other players for synchronized movement.
3.3 Interacting with Chessboards
When a player approaches a chessboard, highlight it as interactable.
If another player is nearby, prompt for a chess game.
Start the game with both players, locking the board to others.
3.4 Chatting
Global chat is always available, allowing players to type messages visible to everyone.
(Optional) Enable private messaging when players are close.
4. Implementation Plan
4.1 Backend
Use WebSocket or Socket.IO for real-time updates (player positions, chat messages, chess games).
Define APIs for:
Player connection and disconnection.
Updating player positions.
Broadcasting chat messages.
Managing chess game state.
Store game and chat history in a database if needed.
4.2 Frontend
Use Canvas or Phaser.js for rendering the 2D room.
Display player avatars and furniture on a grid-based map.
Handle input for movement and interactions.
Integrate the chat UI with a toggleable window.
4.3 Random Player Spawn
Fetch room dimensions and furniture locations from the server.
Calculate random spawn points that are not occupied by furniture or players.
4.4 Chess Game Integration
Embed your existing chess logic into the room.
Use a modal or overlay for the chess game UI.
Broadcast moves in real time to the opponent.
5. Room Data Structure
Store the room layout on the server as a JSON file or in a database.
Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "dimensions": { "width": 1000, "height": 1000 },
  "furniture": [
    { "type": "table", "x": 200, "y": 300 },
    { "type": "chair", "x": 220, "y": 320 }
  ],
  "chessboards": [
    { "id": "board1", "x": 500, "y": 500, "isActive": false }
  ]
}
6. Challenges and Enhancements
Collision Detection: Implement a lightweight physics system for smooth movement and interactions.
Scaling for Multiple Players: Optimize WebSocket communication to handle many players without lag.
Room Customization: Allow furniture updates or themes for future rooms.
Leaderboard: Add a ranking system based on chess performance.

### DATABASE DESIGN

Schema Review
Your schema defines five models: Player, Avatar, Game, Room, and Message. Here are some notes and suggestions:

Player Model:

ID Field:
You have id String @id without a default. If you plan to generate IDs automatically (for example, using UUIDs), you might add @default(uuid()):
prisma
Copy
Edit
id String @id @default(uuid())
Otherwise, ensure that you assign a valid unique string when creating a new Player.
Relations:
The relations to Game and Message are set up using named relations. Make sure you are consistent with the relation names on both sides (which you have done).
Notes:
Consider using enums for state if you want to limit the allowed values (e.g., ONLINE, OFFLINE, DELETED, BANNED). This makes your code more self-documenting.
Avatar Model:

The one-to-one relation with Player is set up correctly by making playerId unique.
The use of Json for appearanceData is fine if you plan to store a variety of appearance settings.
Game Model:

ID Field:
Similar to Player, you might want to add @default(uuid()) to the id field if you want Prisma to generate it automatically:
prisma
Copy
Edit
id String @id @default(uuid())
Relations:
You have three relations involving Player:
white and black are set with their own relation names (whiteGamesWon and blackGamesWon).
The winner relation uses the name "gamesWon" which pairs with Player.gamesWon.
Notes:
If a game can be drawn or if there is no winner, you might consider making winnerId and the corresponding winner relation optional.
Room Model:

The use of Json for max_length is unusual unless you plan to store a complex data structure. If it’s just a number or a pair of values (like width/height), you might consider using an Int or a custom type.
The commented-out relation (playersJoined) is fine if you’re still deciding on how to model players in a room.
Message Model:

The relation to Player using senderId and naming the relation "sender" is correctly set up.
